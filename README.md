## Instructions

Hello player, grader, etc. This is a project for a memory game! 

How it works is pretty simple: 
    - Flip over two cards
        - If the match, they remain flipped over
        - If not, they flip back over.
        
The game records the amount of time the player took to complete the game and the amount of moves it took.

A move is when two cards are flipped over.

The player is also rated on their game play with stars which are also on display. 

Have fun!
